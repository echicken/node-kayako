# node-kayako
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-kayako.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/node-kayako) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/florianholzapfel/node-kayako.png)](https://david-dm.org/florianholzapfel/node-kayako)

As the name already implies, this project implements the API for [Kayako] [1], a helpdesk system.

The implementation currently only allows to retrieve data from Kayako. Updating records will be implemented in the future.

## Getting started

In your shell, install with npm:

```sh
npm install node-kayako
```

In your code:

```javascript
var kayako = require('node-kayako');

var client = new kayako({
	host: <kayako-host>,
	apikey: <kayako-apikey>,
	secret: <kayako-secret>
});

client.userorganizations.get(function (err, organizations) {
	if(err) {
		console.log(err);
	} else {
		console.log(organizations);
	}
});
```

### Unit test ###
You can run the automated unit test using the following command line:

```
HOST=YOUR_KAYAKO_HOST APIKEY=YOUR_APIKEY SECRET=YOUR_SECRET npm test
```

```YOUR_KAYAKO_HOST```, ```YOUR_APIKEY``` and ```YOUR_SECRET``` need to be replaced with correct values.

Although, the unit test is desgined to not modify your Kayako installation (it deletes all objects it creates and does not modify or delete already existing objects), please use it at your **OWN RISK**.
